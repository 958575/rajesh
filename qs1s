QS:1

start with Read the passage from a file or use a hardcoded passage.

Split the passage into words.

Initialize a variable consecutive_the_count to 0 to keep track of consecutive occurrences of 'the' without 'a' in between.

Iterate through the words in the passage.

a. For each word, check if it is 'the'.

b. If it is 'the', check if the next word is also 'the'.

c. If the next word is 'the', check if there is a word 'a' in between. If not, increment consecutive_the_count by 1.

Continue the iteration until all words in the passage have been checked.

Print the value of consecutive_the_count, which represents the count of 'the the' without 'a' in between in the passage.
